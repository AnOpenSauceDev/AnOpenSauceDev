# AnOpenSauceDev
ðŸ‘‹ Oh hey there!

I program things for fun, and this is where I dump all my projects! <br>

This README is pretty sparse because... GitHub shouldn't be treated like social media. Everything on my profile is probably everything im comfortable sharing.

I'm only on the GitHub/Modrinth (and curseforge ðŸ¤¢) platforms currently, and I'm probably best known for being the maintainer + creator of [Methane](https://modrinth.com/mod/methane) and creator of [Faster Random.](https://modrinth.com/mod/faster-random) If you see me anywhere else without a verified link, that's not me.

The programming languages i use (whether in public projects or not) in order of preference are Java, C++, Python/GDscript, Rust, C# and JS.

## Random Programming Advice
(To all the aspiring junior devs out there)

If people are telling you to switch from the tools you are comfortable using to a different editor/programming language **"because it's better"**, Don't listen to that advice! Choose the stuff that is well-supported, suits **your** usecases and feels the most intuitive to you!


**Being bad at multiple programming langauges != being a jack of all trades!** Same goes for your editor. If you aren't pushing the limits of how many keystrokes your fleshy human hands can execute, your programming setup doesn't need to change. 

While I absolutely love Linux, Windows users should not feel a need to switch to it just because their code might "run a bit faster", or "It's the standard", you should do it if what Linux offers makes you faster at doing what you love.

I'm not associated in any way with the **Open Sauce event** (my account was made a **while** before it was created), but Willam Osman is pretty cool.

I don't have much time to work on projects, and the projects I work on are the ones I am the most motivated to work on. If your issue gets buried, I'm sorry. In a few weeks, perhaps I'll be able to work on it.
