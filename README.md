# AnOpenSauceDev
ðŸ‘‹ Oh hey there!

I make random open-source stuff, mostly minecraft on github for now. I'm working on a ridiculous amount of projects at any given time. <br>


I'm only on the GitHub/Modrinth (and curseforge ðŸ¤¢) platforms currently, and I'm probably best known for being the maintainer + creator of [Methane](https://modrinth.com/mod/methane) and creator of [Faster Random.](https://modrinth.com/mod/faster-random)

Mainly using Java, JS and _**very** occasionally_ Rust in the real world. I also mess around with C# and GDScript/Python for some projects.

Currently making a large atrocity with C++.

I plan on replacing all my projects in Godot with Bevy once the engine matures more.

I'm not associated in any way with the Open Sauce event (my account was made a **while** before it was created), but Willam Osman is pretty cool.
