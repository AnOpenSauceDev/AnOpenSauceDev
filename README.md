# AnOpenSauceDev

I write stuff in Java, C++, GDscript/Python + JS! _(...and some Rust)_

I'm now pretty inactive after quitting mod dev, but I still check my github at least once a week.

I'm only present on Modrinth and Curseforge. I don't have any socials (and probably won't) past those for now. Because of that, you probably know me for [Methane](https://github.com/AnOpenSauceDev/Methane-mod) and [Faster Random](https://github.com/AnOpenSauceDev/FastRandom) (and the bug reports caused by those mods, sorry!).
