# AnOpenSauceDev

I write stuff in Java, C++, GDscript/Python and JS! (most of my projects aren't/can't be public _yet_ due to licensing or perfectionism). 
Currently, I'm taking a small break from modding to learn more about graphics programming.

I'm only present on Modrinth and Curseforge. I don't have any socials (and probably won't) past those for now. Because of that, you probably know me for [Methane](https://github.com/AnOpenSauceDev/Methane-mod) and [Faster Random](https://github.com/AnOpenSauceDev/FastRandom) (and the bug reports caused by those mods, sorry!).

Another thing of note is that I usually have less than 4 hours of free time to code for my own projects in a week. If it seems like I'm taking a while to work on an issue, I probably haven't had the chance to work on it.

I use Void Linux, but I typically go as bleeding-edge as possible (which probably isn't a good idea).
