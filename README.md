# AnOpenSauceDev
ðŸ‘‹ Oh hey there!

I make random open-source stuff, mostly minecraft on github for now. <br>
I'm only on the GitHub/Modrinth (and curseforge ðŸ¤¢) platforms currently, and I'm probably best known for being the maintainer + creator of [Methane](https://modrinth.com/mod/methane) and creator of [Faster Random.](https://modrinth.com/mod/faster-random)

Mainly using Java, JS and _**very** occasionally_ Rust in the real world. I also mess around with C# and GDScript/Python for some projects.

Currently learning graphics and shader stuff.
