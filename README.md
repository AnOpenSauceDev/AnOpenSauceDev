ðŸ‘‹ Oh hey there!

I make random open-source stuff, mostly minecraft on github for now. I'm working on a ridiculous amount of projects at any given time. <br>


I'm only on the GitHub/Modrinth (and curseforge ðŸ¤¢) platforms currently, and I'm probably best known for being the maintainer + creator of [Methane](https://modrinth.com/mod/methane) and creator of [Faster Random.](https://modrinth.com/mod/faster-random)

Mainly using Java, JS and _**very** occasionally_ Rust in the real world. I also mess around with C# and GDScript/Python for some projects.

Currently learning graphics and shader stuff every now and then.

Cloudflare is pretty cool.

I'm not associated in any way with the Open Sauce event (my account was made a **while** before it was created), but Willam Osman is pretty cool.
