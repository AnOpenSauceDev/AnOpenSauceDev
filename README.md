# AnOpenSauceDev

I write stuff in Java, C++, GDscript/Python + JS! _(...and some Rust)_

You might notice that I'm not very active from time to time. This is mainly because I spend way too long working on other projects, or learning new tech out of curiosity. Because of this, my modding stuff has taken a back-seat while I improve at programming.

I'm only present on Modrinth and Curseforge. I don't have any socials (and probably won't) past those for now. Because of that, you probably know me for [Methane](https://github.com/AnOpenSauceDev/Methane-mod) and [Faster Random](https://github.com/AnOpenSauceDev/FastRandom) (and the bug reports caused by those mods, sorry!).
